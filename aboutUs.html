      <h2>"Formation of the Belize Coast Guard"</h2>
      <p>
        <br />
        Recognizing the need for a specialized maritime force, the Government of
        Belize officially established the Belize Coast Guard on November 30,
        2005. <br />The BCG was created under the Coast Guard Act of 2005, which
        outlined its mandate, structure, and responsibilities. <br />The primary
        roles of the BCG include maritime law enforcement, search and rescue,
        environmental protection, and supporting national security.
      </p>

    <div class="history">
      <h2>"Early Years of the Belize Coast Guard"</h2>
      <p>
        <br />
        The BCG began operations with limited resources, including a small fleet
        of patrol boats and a handful of personnel. <br />Early missions focused
        on combating illegal fishing, drug trafficking, and providing search and
        rescue services. <br />The BCG received training and equipment support
        from international partners, including the United States, Mexico, and
        Taiwan.

    </div>

    <div class="history">
      <h2>"Expansion of the Belize Coast Guard"</h2>
      <p>
        <br />
        Over the years, the BCG has grown in size and capability, acquiring new
        vessels, radar systems, and other equipment to enhance its operational
        effectiveness. <br />The BCG has established multiple bases along
        Belize's coastline, including in Belize City, Big Creek, <br />
        Calabash, Hunting Caye and San Pedro, to improve its coverage and
        response times.

      <br />The force has also developed a specialized unit, its Special Forces
      Unit, to address specific threats like drug interdiction and port
      security.
