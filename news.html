                Day 2 of the Wonder Woman Competition saw the Belize Coast Guard
                and the Belize Defence Force pull even at 380 points each
                heading into the final day, while the Belize Police Department
                trailed at 320 points. The day’s events featured a grueling
                six-mile run and the CG Medley, both testing the endurance and
                resilience of the competitors. Love News spoke with Major
                Roberta Usher of the Belize Defence Force, who shared her
                thoughts on the day’s hard-fought victory and what it meant for
                her team.
                <br /><br />
                Major Robertha Usher, Belize Defense Force: “ Every day it gets
                harder and harder because the body is worn by now but it was
                alright. You train for it. This morning we were a little
                disappointed because losing a run by seconds is demoralizing. We
                just kind of pushed through this afternoon. It was a close call.
                I don’t even think the official time is out yet. But I think we
                made it. From the get-go I told them, I said after every event
                we just erase it and start new. It’s a new ball game and just
                everybody has to remember everybody is tired. We’re all giving
                our effort, so even if you feel like you could do a little bit
                more, you push yourself. It doesn’t matter what somebody else is
                doing, because at the end of the day, it’s one team.” The
                competition has seen the Belize Police Department face
                challenges, but this has not dampened the morale of its
                participants. Assistant Commissioner of Police, Jane Usher,
                emphasized that, regardless of the outcome, they take pride in
                knowing they have given their absolute best.
                <br /><br />
                Jane Usher, Assistant Superintendent of Police: “My team has
                been sticking together and I’m really proud of the girls for
                that. You know, we know, like I said, we know our strengths, we
                know our weaknesses, we know what is the best we can do and at
                the end of the day, all we can do is give it our all. And I
                think we did that, especially on this last run, even on the six
                mile run this morning. This morning we had a six mile run. In
                training, our best time as a team was one hour. We did a little
                bit more than that, but that’s after two events yesterday. So
                the girls… pushed and that’s all I ask of them. This afternoon I
                think we really did well. I wasn’t supposed to even compete so
                just jumping in to assist them so that we could have a stronger
                team tomorrow as well we’re just trying to strategize as best we
                can and learning as we go and I think the girls are really doing
                their best so that’s good for us. We’re a bit behind in points
                and you know but we’re going to give it our all and even if we
                win one event or you know one evolution as they call it we get
                excited for that because we know at the end of the day, even if
                we get third we put in the best that we could. And so it doesn’t
                matter when we line up, we go in believing that we can do this.
                We are females just like they are. We are law enforcement just
                like they are. We put on our socks one foot at a time, just like
                they do. And so we go believing that we can do it and then may
                the best team win.”
                <br /><br />
                The final events will be the March and Shoot and the CG
                Crucible.

                Yesterday, a man was rescued by the Belize Coast Guard after he
                was lost at sea for several hours. Around 5:00 p.m., the Belize
                Coast Guard received information of a man drifting on a
                makeshift raft approximately 17 miles south of Belize City. The
                BCG dispatched a crew and found 57-year-old Carlos Pinto sitting
                on a bucket while drifting on the raft made of wood and metal.
                Pinto was reportedly confused and could not provide the seamen
                with his name or address, leading to the BCG pleading for the
                public’s assistance on Facebook. The post was seen by his
                family, and he was identified. Pinto reportedly grew weary of
                working as a security guard on an island outside Belize City and
                decided to set off. He was found with his personal belongings,
                food, and a wooden paddle. Commandant of the Belize Coast Guard,
                Rear Admiral Elton Bennett, spoke about the operation.

                The Belize Coast Guard is working to raise the salaries of its
                members who are being underpaid. Coast Guard Commandant Rear
                Admiral Elton Bennett explained that the BCG launched the
                People’s Operation, last year, an initiative aimed at reviewing
                salaries and getting personnel properly compensated. Bennett
                says that the need for the operation was brought up at the last
                BCG senior officers conference. Since the operation has rolled
                out, around 200 personnel have gotten a salary increase with
                more on the way.

                The issue of stolen vessels is also one that the Belize Coast
                Guard has had to tackle in the past year. Commander Elton
                Bennett told Love News that there is a ring that extends as far
                as Honduras when it comes to stolen vessels in Belize’s waters.
                <br /><br />
                RADM Elton Bennett, Belize Coast Guard Commandant: “And as we
                relate to maritime crime, there’s a lot of vessel theft as of
                recent targeting areas of San Pedro, Caye Caulker and even down
                in Placencia that we are very concerned about. So again, this is
                a new phenomena that is plaguing our maritime space. We believe
                that there is a ring between Belize and Honduras where these
                vessels would be stripped for engine and other accessories.”

                Law enforcement officials will be on high alert over the
                Christmas season on both land and sea. As it relates to maritime
                security, Rear Admiral Elton Bennett of the Belize Coast Guard
                told Love News that his teams will be deployed at all bases. He
                noted that the holiday strategy also entails having support
                teams on call to assist should any situation develop. As
                families make final preparations for the Christmas, Commander
                Bennett, expressed gratitude to those who support the seamen and
                officers on call for the holidays.
                <br /><br />
                RADM Elton Bennett, Belize Coast Guard Commandant: “The Coast
                Guard remains operationally committed throughout the holiday
                season. We have our Forward Operating Basses that are up and
                operational. We have aggressive patrolling in areas where we
                believe there may be vulnerable mariners and fisherfolk so we
                have a specially designed operation to ensure that both maritime
                security but also maritime safety of mariners transiting
                Belizean waters is kept on our Coast Guard radar and that we’re
                able to respond to any eventualities that may occur out at sea
                during this period. So as far north as Consejo our border with
                Mexico and as far south as Barranco and Hunting Caye the Belize
                Coast Guard will continue to patrol those areas maintaining
                watch across our sea spaces, throughout the Christmas season. We
                do not collapse operations at any point. Our operations remain
                forward deployed. The state of readiness and the ability to
                respond to any maritime eventualities is still out there.
                There’s no reconfiguring of operations to scale it down. As a
                matter of fact over this Christmas season, over the holidays we
                remain an extra level of vigilance because people become
                vulnerable during this time of year as well and that translates
                to mariners out at sea as well. So the Coast Guard maintains
                watch.”
