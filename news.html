            The Belize Coast Guard is working to raise the salaries of its
            members who are being underpaid. Coast Guard Commandant Rear Admiral
            Elton Bennett explained that the BCG launched the People’s
            Operation, last year, an initiative aimed at reviewing salaries and
            getting personnel properly compensated. Bennett says that the need
            for the operation was brought up at the last BCG senior officers
            conference. Since the operation has rolled out, around 200 personnel
            have gotten a salary increase with more on the way.

            Stolen Vessels Ring Linked to Honduras: Coast Guard Tackles Ongoing

        <div class="right-bottom-div">
          <p>
            The issue of stolen vessels is also one that the Belize Coast Guard
            has had to tackle in the past year. Commander Elton Bennett told
            Love News that there is a ring that extends as far as Honduras when
            it comes to stolen vessels in Belize’s waters. <br /><br />
            <b>RADM Elton Bennett, Belize Coast Guard Commandant:</b><br />
            “And as we relate to maritime crime, there’s a lot of vessel theft
            as of recent targeting areas of San Pedro, Caye Caulker and even
            down in Placencia that we are very concerned about. So again, this
            is a new phenomena that is plaguing our maritime space. We believe
            that there is a ring between Belize and Honduras where these vessels
            would be stripped for engine and other accessories.”

            Belize Coast Guard Remains on Alert for Holiday Maritime Security
          </h2>

        <div class="right-bottom-div">
          <p>
            Law enforcement officials will be on high alert over the Christmas
            season on both land and sea. As it relates to maritime security,
            Rear Admiral Elton Bennett of the Belize Coast Guard told Love News
            that his teams will be deployed at all bases. He noted that the
            holiday strategy also entails having support teams on call to assist
            should any situation develop. As families make final preparations
            for the Christmas, Commander Bennett, expressed gratitude to those
            who support the seamen and officers on call for the holidays.
            <br /><br />
            <b>RADM Elton Bennett, Belize Coast Guard Commandant:</b><br />
            “The Coast Guard remains operationally committed throughout the
            holiday season. We have our Forward Operating Basses that are up and
            operational. We have aggressive patrolling in areas where we believe
            there may be vulnerable mariners and fisherfolk so we have a
            specially designed operation to ensure that both maritime security
            but also maritime safety of mariners transiting Belizean waters is
            kept on our Coast Guard radar and that we’re able to respond to any
            eventualities that may occur out at sea during this period. So as
            far north as Consejo our border with Mexico and as far south as
            Barranco and Hunting Caye the Belize Coast Guard will continue to
            patrol those areas maintaining watch across our sea spaces,
            throughout the Christmas season. We do not collapse operations at
            any point. Our operations remain forward deployed. The state of
            readiness and the ability to respond to any maritime eventualities
            is still out there. There’s no reconfiguring of operations to scale
            it down. As a matter of fact over this Christmas season, over the
            holidays we remain an extra level of vigilance because people become
            vulnerable during this time of year as well and that translates to
            mariners out at sea as well. So the Coast Guard maintains watch.”
