              </h3>
              <p>
                <br />The Belize Coast Guard is working to raise the salaries of
                its members who are being underpaid. Coast Guard Commandant Rear
                Admiral Elton Bennett explained that the BCG launched the
                People's Operation, last year, an initiative aimed at reviewing
                salaries and getting personnel properly compensated. Bennett
                says that the need for the operation was brought up at the last
                BCG senior officers conference. Since the operation has rolled
                out, around 200 personnel have gotten a salary increase with
                more on the way.

              </h3>
              <p>
                <br />The issue of stolen vessels is also one that the Belize
                Coast Guard has had to tackle in the past year. Commander Elton
                Bennett told Love News that there is a ring that extends as far
                as Honduras when it comes to stolen vessels in Belize's waters.
                <br /><br />
                <b>RADM Elton Bennett, Belize Coast Guard Commandant:</b><br />
                "And as we relate to maritime crime, there's a lot of vessel
                theft as of recent targeting areas of San Pedro, Caye Caulker
                and even down in Placencia that we are very concerned about. So
                again, this is a new phenomena that is plaguing our maritime
                space. We believe that there is a ring between Belize and
                Honduras where these vessels would be stripped for engine and
                other accessories."

                Security
              </h3>
              <p>
                <br />Law enforcement officials will be on high alert over the
                Christmas season on both land and sea. As it relates to maritime
                security, Rear Admiral Elton Bennett of the Belize Coast Guard
                told Love News that his teams will be deployed at all bases. He
                noted that the holiday strategy also entails having support
                teams on call to assist should any situation develop. As
                families make final preparations for the Christmas, Commander
                Bennett, expressed gratitude to those who support the seamen and
                officers on call for the holidays. <br /><br />
                <b>RADM Elton Bennett, Belize Coast Guard Commandant:</b><br />
                "The Coast Guard remains operationally committed throughout the
                holiday season. We have our Forward Operating Basses that are up
                and operational. We have aggressive patrolling in areas where we
                believe there may be vulnerable mariners and fisherfolk so we
                have a specially designed operation to ensure that both maritime
                security but also maritime safety of mariners transiting
                Belizean waters is kept on our Coast Guard radar and that we're
                able to respond to any eventualities that may occur out at sea
                during this period. So as far north as Consejo our border with
                Mexico and as far south as Barranco and Hunting Caye the Belize
                Coast Guard will continue to patrol those areas maintaining
                watch across our sea spaces, throughout the Christmas season. We
                do not collapse operations at any point. Our operations remain
                forward deployed. The state of readiness and the ability to
                respond to any maritime eventualities is still out there.
                There's no reconfiguring of operations to scale it down. As a
                matter of fact over this Christmas season, over the holidays we
                remain an extra level of vigilance because people become
                vulnerable during this time of year as well and that translates
                to mariners out at sea as well. So the Coast Guard maintains
                watch."
