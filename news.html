              <h3>
                Coast Guard Team Alpha Crowned Wonder Woman 2025 Champions
              </h3>
              <p>
                <br />In a most anxious, high energy and combative Wonder Woman
                Competition yet your Coast Guard TEAM ALPHA was crowned 2025
                Champions. In its nine years of running never have we witnessed
                such a tightly contested competition where the lead was
                alternated after every event culminating on the final event, the
                Crucible. Initiating six events in three days our women across
                the Tri-service certainly demonstrated a high level of physical
                fitness, determination, leadership and team spirit that inspired
                our nation. The Wonder Woman Competition is evidently the most
                arduous challenge in our Country and our women conquered it in
                competitive fashion and high spirits. The BDF and Coast Guard
                teams were equally matched. alternating lead throughout and
                winning by seconds on occasions leaving fans and supporters on
                edge and engaged throughout the three days of activities. Team
                Police had a special drive and motivation that brought
                continuous energy throughout the competition. They were always
                on the edge, on the verge of winning this one, or the next
                event. And they kept that motivation throughout. At the start of
                the competition Team BDF demonstrated the best total body
                fitness in the Coast Guard Fitness Test that comprised push-ups,
                sit ups, pull ups and a two-mile run. Lance Corporal Paquit
                knocked out at impressive 76 push ups in the two-minute drill.
                And whilst the Coast Guard team had the best running time, the
                overall tally placed the defending champs BDF in the lead. The
                lead changed after the one-mile swim – two mile run in light
                chop to choppy seas, an event that favored the Coast Guard team
                due to the swim. Coast Guard Seaman Chrysta Guydis had the best
                swimming time with forty-nine minutes. At the end of day one The
                BDF and Coast Guard were tied. Day two started with a six mile
                road run that was won by the Coast Guard by a mere 17 seconds.
                However the BDF tied the competition at the end of day two by
                winning the Medley by 20 seconds. Day three started with a march
                and shoot competition through the Hattieville – Boom road
                culminating at the Hattieville gallery range. BDF won the 8 mile
                road march putting pressure on the Coast Guard on the shooting
                event. Both BDF and Coast Guard fell all twenty falling plates,
                but the Coast Guard did it in a better time and also handed in
                17 live rounds less than the BDF resulting in a tie after the
                march and shoot. Team Police also had a very good shooting day
                by hitting 11 of the falling plates.

              </h3>
              <p>
                <br />A man was rescued by the Belize Coast Guard after he was
                lost at sea for several hours. On March 25th, around 5:00 p.m.,
                the Belize Coast Guard received information of a man drifting on
                a makeshift raft approximately 17 miles south of Belize City.
                The BCG dispatched a crew and found 57-year-old Carlos Pinto
                sitting on a bucket while drifting on the raft made of wood and
                metal. Pinto was reportedly confused and could not provide the
                seamen with his name or address, leading to the BCG pleading for
                the public’s assistance on Facebook. The post was seen by his
                family, and he was identified. Pinto reportedly grew weary of
                working as a security guard on an island outside Belize City and
                decided to set off. He was found with his personal belongings,
                food, and a wooden paddle. Commandant of the Belize Coast Guard,
                Rear Admiral Elton Bennett, spoke about the operation. After the
                rescue, Pinto was transported to the Karl Heusner Memorial
                Hospital for medical attention.

                <br />The Belize Coast Guard is working to raise the salaries of

                Admiral Elton Bennett explained that the BCG launched the
                People's Operation, last year, an initiative aimed at reviewing
                salaries and getting personnel properly compensated. Bennett
                says that the need for the operation was brought up at the last
                BCG senior officers conference. Since the operation has rolled
                out, around 200 personnel have gotten a salary increase with
                more on the way.

              <p>
                <br />The issue of stolen vessels is also one that the Belize
                Coast Guard has had to tackle in the past year. Commander Elton
                Bennett told Love News that there is a ring that extends as far
                as Honduras when it comes to stolen vessels in Belize's waters.
                <br /><br />
                <b>RADM Elton Bennett, Belize Coast Guard Commandant:</b><br />
                "And as we relate to maritime crime, there's a lot of vessel
                theft as of recent targeting areas of San Pedro, Caye Caulker
                and even down in Placencia that we are very concerned about. So
                again, this is a new phenomena that is plaguing our maritime
                space. We believe that there is a ring between Belize and
                Honduras where these vessels would be stripped for engine and
                other accessories."

              </h3>
              <p>
                <br />Law enforcement officials will be on high alert over the
                Christmas season on both land and sea. As it relates to maritime
                security, Rear Admiral Elton Bennett of the Belize Coast Guard
                told Love News that his teams will be deployed at all bases. He
                noted that the holiday strategy also entails having support
                teams on call to assist should any situation develop. As
                families make final preparations for the Christmas, Commander
                Bennett, expressed gratitude to those who support the seamen and
                officers on call for the holidays. <br /><br />
                <b>RADM Elton Bennett, Belize Coast Guard Commandant:</b><br />
                "The Coast Guard remains operationally committed throughout the
                holiday season. We have our Forward Operating Basses that are up
                and operational. We have aggressive patrolling in areas where we
                believe there may be vulnerable mariners and fisherfolk so we
                have a specially designed operation to ensure that both maritime
                security but also maritime safety of mariners transiting
                Belizean waters is kept on our Coast Guard radar and that we're
                able to respond to any eventualities that may occur out at sea
                during this period. So as far north as Consejo our border with
                Mexico and as far south as Barranco and Hunting Caye the Belize
                Coast Guard will continue to patrol those areas maintaining
                watch across our sea spaces, throughout the Christmas season. We
                do not collapse operations at any point. Our operations remain
                forward deployed. The state of readiness and the ability to
                respond to any maritime eventualities is still out there.
                There's no reconfiguring of operations to scale it down. As a
                matter of fact over this Christmas season, over the holidays we
                remain an extra level of vigilance because people become
                vulnerable during this time of year as well and that translates
                to mariners out at sea as well. So the Coast Guard maintains
                watch."

              <h3>Coast Guard Launches Marine Conservation Initiative</h3>
              <p>
                <br />The Belize Coast Guard has partnered with the Department
                of the Environment to launch "Operation Blue Shield," a new
                initiative to protect marine ecosystems and combat illegal
                fishing activities. The program will deploy specialized patrol
                units to monitor protected areas, including the Belize Barrier
                Reef Reserve System. In its first month of operation, the
                initiative has already resulted in the interception of three
                vessels engaged in illegal fishing activities and the
                documentation of several cases of marine habitat destruction.
                The Coast Guard has committed to dedicating 20% of its
                operational resources to environmental protection missions
                moving forward.
